## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
- JS Document Object Model (DOM) 

### What I learned

I learned how useful JavaScript can be with front end development. It allows scripting to be preformed on the client-side host, not needing to hassle with server-side host for simple scripts  

### Continued development

A lot more comfortable with CSS layout. I will continue going foward with JavaScript because it can add so much to the functionality of a web-page. Will also start looking into apis more in depth.  

### Useful resources

- [DOM with Beau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaLKqoB9Fu0&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbllLK6r2dnGjUVWB_cFNcuO) - This helped me to actually implement my script into my HTML web page. I figured this is barely scratching the surface and would like to learn more.
